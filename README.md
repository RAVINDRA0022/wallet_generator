# Wallet Discovery Module and Testbench Documentation

## Overview
The Wallet Discovery module is designed to generate sequential private keys, derive their corresponding public keys and wallet addresses, and compare them against a user-defined vanity hash pattern. The module supports parallel processing through multiple pipelines to enhance performance.

The testbench verifies the functionality of the Wallet Discovery module, including clock-driven operations, reset behavior, and edge cases for pattern matching.

## Wallet Discovery Module

### Features
1. **Parallel Processing**:
   - The module uses multiple pipelines (`NUM_PIPELINES`) to generate keys and perform vanity hash matching simultaneously.
2. **Configurable Parameters**:
   - `NUM_PIPELINES`: Determines the number of parallel processing units.
   - `KEY_WIDTH`: Specifies the bit-width of the private key.
   - `HASH_WIDTH`: Specifies the bit-width of the hash output (compatible with SHA-256).
3. **Reset Support**:
   - Resets all internal states and restarts the key generation sequence.

### Inputs and Outputs
   Signal                  Width       Direction         Description                                              

  `clk`                   1-bit         Input        Clock signal driving the module.                        
  `reset`                1-bit          Input       Resets the module when asserted.                        
  `vanity_pattern`       256-bit        Input        User-defined hash pattern for vanity matching.          
  `match_found`           1-bit         Output      Indicates if a matching hash was found.                 
  `matching_private_key`  256-bit       Output      Outputs the private key corresponding to the match.     

### Functional Description
The module performs the following steps:
1. **Private Key Generation**:
   - Each pipeline generates sequential private keys, starting from a unique initial value.
2. **ECC Public Key Derivation**:
   - The private key is used to compute the corresponding public key (stubbed for simplicity).
3. **SHA-256 Hashing**:
   - The public key is hashed to obtain the wallet address.
4. **Vanity Hash Matching**:
   - The hash is compared with the user-defined pattern. If a match is found, the private key is recorded and output.

## Testbench

### Features
1. **Clock Signal Generation**:
   - A 10ns clock period is generated for module operation.
2. **Reset Testing**:
   - Asserts and deasserts the reset signal to verify module initialization.
3. **Vanity Pattern Testing**:
   - Tests the module with various patterns to validate functionality.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Simulates scenarios with low key ranges and pattern changes during operation.

### Testbench Components

 `match_found`           1-bit         Output      Monitors if the DUT finds a match.                      
 `matching_private_key`  256-bit       Output      Outputs the matching private key from the DUT.          

### Test Scenarios
#### 1. **Basic Functionality**:
- **Objective**: Verify if the DUT correctly identifies a match for a given pattern.
- **Setup**:
  - Initialize with `reset = 1`.
  - Provide `vanity_pattern = 256'hCAFEBABECAFEBABECAFEBABECAFEBABE`.
- **Expected Result**: `match_found` is asserted, and `matching_private_key` contains the corresponding private key.

#### 2. **Pattern Change**:
- **Objective**: Test the DUTâ€™s behavior when the pattern changes mid-simulation.
- **Setup**:
  - Provide an initial pattern `256'hCAFEBABECAFEBABECAFEBABECAFEBABE`.
  - Change to `256'hDEADBEEFDEADBEEFDEADBEEFDEADBEEF` after 200ns.
- **Expected Result**: The DUT continues processing with the updated pattern.

#### 3. **Reset Behavior**:
- **Objective**: Verify module reset functionality.
- **Setup**:
  - Assert `reset = 1` for 20ns.
  - Deassert `reset` and resume operation.
- **Expected Result**: All internal states are reinitialized.

#### 4. **Edge Case: Low Key Range**:
- **Objective**: Simulate low key values to test robustness.
- **Setup**:
  - Set `vanity_pattern = 256'h00000000000000000000000000000000`.
- **Expected Result**: The DUT processes the low key range without errors.
